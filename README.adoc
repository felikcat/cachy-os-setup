==== 1. Flashing the CachyOS ISO
. Download the https://cachyos.org/download/[CachyOS Desktop Edition] ISO, then install https://etcher.balena.io/[balenaEtcher] to flash that ISO onto a USB drive, so that you can restart your PC and boot into the CachyOS live environment.

==== 2. After booted into the CachyOS ISO
. Launch the installer.
. Choose 'Refind' for the bootloader.
. *Partitions*: Choose the 'btrfs' partition type, and enable 'Encrypt system' with your desired password.
. *Desktop*: Choose the 'Plasma Desktop'.
. *Packages*: Uncheck 'Firefox and language package' and proceed.
. *Users*: Check 'Log in automatically without asking for the password'.
. After installation is finished, reboot and unplug the USB.

==== Installing Flatpaks via the Bazaar app store
. Flatpaks have better security than native Arch packages, but you still need to check what levels of isolations each Flatpak has by default, and adjust accordingly using Flatseal if desired: +
`sudo pacman -S flatpak && flatpak install flathub com.github.tchx84.Flatseal io.github.kolunmi.Bazaar`
. Reboot, then install what applications you want using Bazaar, such as Vencord to use Discord.

==== Wine setup (makes most Windows applications compatible with Linux)
. `sudo pacman -S wine-staging wine-mono winetricks`
. `winetricks -q vcrun2022 dxvk allfonts nocrashdialog autostart_winedbg=disabled`
. Now you can install the Windows version of https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/client/installer/SteamSetup.exe[Steam] or do whatever else you'd like using Wine. Keep in mind that Windows malware can do damage to files on Linux, unless that Wine instance is sandboxed using https://github.com/hartwork/sandwine[sandwine].

==== Running AppImages
- `sudo pacman -S fuse2` and enjoy.

==== Making Steam games launch much faster
. Go to Steam Settings -> Downloads.
. Scroll down until you see "Shader Pre-Caching", then disable "Enable Shader Pre-caching". This won't slow down the performance of games on modern GPUs, far as I know.

==== Setup for modding Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, or other Bethesda games
. `sudo pacman -S steam && flatpak install flathub com.github.Matoking.protontricks com.vysp3r.ProtonPlus`
. Run Steam at least once and login.
. Install the latest Proton-EM through ProtonPlus, then restart Steam.
. Download the latest AppImage of https://github.com/Omni-guides/Jackify[Jackify] and run it, this is what'll install the mods (for Wabbajack based modpacks).

==== GPU management (undervolting, overclocking, fan control, power state control)
. `sudo pacman -S lact && sudo systemctl enable --now lactd.service`
. Open LACT, click on 'OC', then 'Enable AMD Overclocking' (or whatever it's called for your GPU), then reboot after it says to.

==== Disabling one annoyance specific to CachyOS
- Edit: `~/.config/fish/config.fish`
----
# Add the following:
function fish_greeting
end

==== Installing a good anti-malware product
TIP: Recommended for risky environments, such as web development. +
If you aren't isolating everything potentially dangerous in a virtual machine or sandboxing solution like sandwine or bubblewrap, using Dr.Web is a good idea. +
- It is $38 USD a year for 5 devices.

. Download the https://products.drweb.com/home/linux/[Dr.Web Security Space] trial.
. Use "Free download (64-bit)".
. `chmod +x ~/Downloads drweb*.run`
. `./Downloads/drweb-*.run`
. Make sure "I want to connect to Dr.Web Cloud" is checked before installing.
. Run Dr.Web for Linux and enable SpIDer Guard and SpIDer Gate. If you have any connection issues after doing this, disable SpIDer Gate.
